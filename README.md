# RNAVarietyCalculator
Calculates differences in DNA

RNACalculator offers a very simple GUI design using tkinter

Each string accepted in the input is turned into groups of four amino acids, such as ATCGGCTG -> ATCG GCTG, each forming a singular gene
Then these genes are compared to see if they match or not, results will be out in a percentage that matches, visual support will be added soon.

The main goal is to make a mini version of something that would be functional at extraordinary sizes where there are thousands or millions of genes
